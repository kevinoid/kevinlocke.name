A common tactic to increase performance and decrease bandwidth is to compress
HTTP responses.  This is particularly useful for text content such as the CSS,
JavaScript, and HTML that are fundamental to the web.  There are several
different methods for configuring compression in Apache, but most have subtle
(or not so subtle) issues.  This post continues the series of `MultiViews`
posts (after the earlier
[XHTML]({% post_url 2012-07-20-serving-xhtml-with-apache-multiviews %}) and
[ErrorDocuments]({% post_url 2015-10-01-a-warning-about-errordocument-with-multiviews %})
posts) by outlining the problems encountered in popular compression
configurations and how to avoid them using `MultiViews`.

## Non-MultiViews Methods

In order to motivate the choice of `MultiViews` for serving pre-compressed
content, it's useful to consider the popular alternatives.  The first is using
[`mod_deflate`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_deflate.html) to
compress response content on the fly.  This works well for dynamic content,
but wastes resources for static content, which is needlessly recompressed for
each request.

This limitation of `mod_deflate` is prominently mentioned in the
documentation, [which
recommends](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_deflate.html#precompressed)
using [`mod_rewrite`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_rewrite.html)
to rewrite requests to their compressed alternatives when appropriate.
Although this method can work (and [I recommended it to get the desired
behavior for
XHTML]({% post_url 2012-07-20-serving-xhtml-with-apache-multiviews %}))
it has the major drawback that you are reimplementing [content
negotiation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/content-negotiation.html)
(which
[`mod_negotiation`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_negotiation.html)
was designed to do) and are likely to get it wrong and lack features supported
by `mod_negotiation`.  Some common problems and pitfalls with this approach:

- Sending an incorrect or missing `Content-Encoding` header.
- Not sending the `Vary` header or setting it incorrectly (overwriting
  previous values for other headers which cause the response to vary).
- Sending `Content-Type: application/x-gzip` instead of the underlying type.
- Sending double-gzipped content due to forgetting to set `no-gzip` in the
  environment to exclude the response from `mod_deflate`.
- Not respecting client preferences (i.e. quality values/qvalues).  According
  to [RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.4) (and
  [RFC 2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.3) before it)
  clients can send a numeric value between 0 and 1 (inclusive) to express
  their relative preference for each encoding.  An `Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=0`
  header would signify that the client wants "anything but gzip".  Most
  `mod_rewrite` implementations would send them gzip.  A more realistic
  example would be a client that sends `Accept-Encoding: br;q=1, gzip;q=0.5,
  deflate;q=0.1` to signify that they prefer Brotli, then gzip, then deflate.
  Writing `mod_rewrite` rules which properly handle these sorts of expressed
  preferences is extremely difficult.

In addition to the above issues, this approach requires writing a redirect
rule for each supported combination of negotiated values.  Supporting gzip
encoding for a few file extensions is reasonable, but if additional types and
encodings are added (much less languages or charsets) it quickly becomes
unreasonable.  It also doesn't support any of the features of [Transparent
Content Negotiation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2295) which are supported
out of the box by `mod_negotiation`.

## Building A Solution Using MultiViews

### Prerequisites

As in previous posts, we will build up a solution iteratively, tackling
problems as they appear.  For this to work, `mod_mime` and `mod_negotiation`
must be enabled/loaded.   On Debian and related distributions this can be done
by running `a2enmod mime` and `a2enmod negotiation` as root.  Additionally,
`mod_deflate` should not be applied to negotiated files/types.  This can be
accomplished by removing its default configuration symlink at
`/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/deflate.conf` or disabling the module with
`a2dismod -f deflate`.

The following examples use the domain `localhost` and assume the file
`style.css.gz` exists in the site root.

### First Steps

We start by simply enabling `MultiViews` and declaring the extension `.gz` to
identify the gzip encoding using following configuration (which must be inside
a `<Directory>` directive or `.htaccess` file, as noted in the description of
the `MultiViews` value for
[`Options`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#options)):

``` apache
Options +MultiViews
AddEncoding gzip .gz
```

If we test the result using `curl -I -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip"
http://localhost/style.css` we get something like the following:

``` http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 21 Jan 2017 01:11:40 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)
Content-Location: style.css.gz
Vary: negotiate,accept-encoding
TCN: choice
Last-Modified: Sat, 21 Jan 2017 01:04:11 GMT
ETag: "538-5469058274adb;546906978a4c6"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 1336
Content-Type: text/css
Content-Encoding: gzip
```

Notice that the server sent a response with the correct `Content-Type` and
`Content-Encoding` and as a bonus it included the
[TCN](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2295) headers to inform clients that the
result was negotiated and there may be other representations available.
Hurray!

### Non-Negotiated Files

Not so fast!  If we add an uncompressed `style.css` file to the site root, the
same request returns:

``` http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 21 Jan 2017 01:15:34 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)
Last-Modified: Sat, 21 Jan 2017 00:05:41 GMT
ETag: "f9d-5468f86e84147"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 3997
Content-Type: text/css
```

This response is neither negotiated or compressed!  What happened?
Unfortunately, [`MultiViews` only negotiates requests for files which do not
exist](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_negotiation.html#multiviews).
After adding `style.css` the request matched the uncompressed file exactly, so
the response was not negotiated and the uncompressed file was sent.  This
makes what we are trying to do particularly difficult ([Bug
60619](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60619)).

A solution is to rename the uncompressed file with an additional extension
such as `.orig` or `.id` (for the `identity` encoding) and include that
extension in negotiation.  This could be done by adding [`MultiviewsMatch
Any`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_mime.html#multiviewsmatch),
although this risks matching unexpected file types (e.g. if a type is not
assigned to `.md5`, `.asc`, `.torrent` or other additional extensions).  It
could also be done by assigning `.orig` to a negotiated feature.  The obvious
choice would be encoding: `AddEncoding identity .orig`.  Unfortunately, this
does not work as expected since Apache treats the `identity` encoding
differently from an unspecified encoding with undesired results (e.g. gzip is
served for requests without `Accept-Encoding` because it is smaller than the
uncompressed file).  Another option would be to assign `.orig` to a default
charset or language, such as `AddCharset utf-8 .orig` or `AddLanguage en
.orig` if all compressed files are UTF-8 or English.  A third option, which I
find more appealing, is to use a no-op filter or handler such as the
[`default-handler`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/handler.html) and
allow `MultiViews` to match extensions assigned to handlers:

``` apache
Options +MultiViews
AddEncoding gzip .gz
MultiviewsMatch Handlers
AddHandler default-handler .orig
```

After a bit more digging, I found [Fran√ßois Marier has an even better
solution](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/serving-pre-compressed-files-using/)
of doubling the type extension.  So `style.css` is saved as `style.css.css` on
the server and requests for `/style.css` are negotiated between
`style.css.css` (no encoding) and `style.css.gz` (gzip encoding).  This has
the added advantage of not interfering with the type-detection of any other
tools which may open the file on the server that do not recognize the .orig
file extension.

### Fixing Incorrect .gz Type

A problem with the above solution appears if we request `style.css.gz`
directly or request `style` without an extension to negotiate the
`Content-Type`.[^negotiatetype] Consider the result for `curl -I -H
"Accept-Encoding: gzip" http://localhost/style`:

``` http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 21 Jan 2016 01:08:30 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.18 (Debian)
Content-Location: style.css.gz
Vary: negotiate,accept,accept-encoding
TCN: choice
Last-Modified: Thu, 21 Jan 2017 01:00:51 GMT
ETag: "536-529cda2456c78;529cdb967800b"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 1334
Content-Type: application/x-gzip
Content-Encoding: gzip
```

This is all sorts of wrong (although it is common enough that [Firefox detects
it and provides a
workaround](https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-esr38/source/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpChannel.cpp#4291)).
We wanted to send the browser a stylesheet, but instead we sent it a gzip file
(according to `Content-Type`) which is gzipped (according to
`Content-Encoding`).  We actually sent it the same gzipped stylesheet, but
with the wrong `Content-Type`.  This is because Debian (and related
distributions) set `AddType application/x-gzip .gz` in their default
configuration (in `/etc/apache2/mods-available/mime.conf`), so for
`style.css.gz` the `.gz` is being interpreted as both the type and the
encoding of the file.  This can be fixed using `RemoveType` as follows:

``` apache
Options +MultiViews
RemoveType .gz
AddEncoding gzip .gz
```

With this fix, the response now includes the correct headers, as in the first
example response above.  Unfortunately, we've introduced a new problem.
Suppose we are hosting a gzipped-tarball `launch-codes.tar.gz`.  Requesting it
results in a response similar to the following:

``` http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 21 Jan 2016 01:32:51 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.18 (Debian)
Last-Modified: Thu, 21 Jan 2017 01:27:34 GMT
ETag: "3b709-529ce01dc4107"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 243465
Content-Type: application/x-tar
Content-Encoding: gzip
```

This tells the browser that we are sending it a tar file which is compressed
for transmission.  So, if the browser didn't have [workarounds for this
brokenness
too](https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-esr38/source/uriloader/exthandler/nsExternalHelperAppService.cpp#572)),
it would decompress the response content and save the file as
`launch-codes.tar` (or worse `launch-codes.tar.gz`) with uncompressed content.
What we actually wanted was to send a gzipped file with no additional content
encoding.  We can achieve that by adding some further configuration to
`.tar.gz` files:

``` apache
Options +MultiViews
RemoveType .gz
AddEncoding gzip .gz
<FilesMatch ".+\.tar\.gz$">
    RemoveEncoding .gz
    AddType application/gzip .gz
</FilesMatch>
```

This approach can easily be extended to any other compound file extensions
that should be saved without gunzipping by altering the `FilesMatch`
expression.  It uses the `application/gzip` type of [RFC
6713](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6713), which is the official type of gzip
files, but which lacks the same browser support as the legacy
`application/x-gzip` type.  Administrators concerned about older browsers
should use the legacy type.  Also, as a matter of style, the configuration
could have used `ForceType` instead of `AddType` within the `FilesMatch`
directive.

With this configuration we have eliminated all of the previous issues and
achieved the desired result.  It can also be extend to include additional
encodings easily, as we will demonstrate.


### An Alternative Fix

[Leo Bicknell](http://www.ufp.org/~bicknell/) suggested an alternative fix for
the incorrect `.gz` type:  Use a different extension!  For example, by using
the `.gzip` extension with `AddEncoding gzip .gzip` and saving compressed
files with this extension.  This has the advantage that files saved with the
`.gz` extension are served as `application/gzip` as intended, and only files
which should be transparently decompressed are served with `Content-Encoding:
gzip`.


### Adding Brotli

Now that we have found a working solution using `MultiViews`, lets add support
for
[Brotli](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/11/better-than-gzip-compression-with-brotli/)
as icing on the cake.

The first question is what extension to use, since the [brotli
tool](https://github.com/google/brotli) does not provide one.  Using `.br`
analogously to `.gz` provokes a conflict with the [ISO 639 language
code](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) for Breton,
which is configured by default (but can be addressed by `RemoveLanguage .br`).
Using `.bro` as suggested in [this pull
request](https://github.com/google/brotli/pull/163) has already been [rejected
by Mozilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=366559#c147).  So
lets use `.brotli` as a neutral, if verbose, choice.

``` apache
Options +MultiViews
RemoveType .gz
AddEncoding gzip .gz
AddEncoding br .brotli
<FilesMatch ".+\.tar\.gz$">
    RemoveEncoding .gz
    AddType application/gzip .gz
</FilesMatch>
```

If we then create `style.css.brotli` with `brotli < style.css.orig >
style.css.brotli`, a test request with `curl -I -H 'Accept-Encoding:
br' http://localhost/style.css` yields:

``` http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 21 Jan 2017 03:07:00 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)
Content-Location: style.css.brotli
Vary: negotiate,accept-encoding
TCN: choice
Last-Modified: Sat, 21 Jan 2017 03:05:02 GMT
ETag: "43b-54692084e8c35;546920f3c26ac"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 1083
Content-Type: text/css
Content-Encoding: br
```

Hurrah!

## The MultiViews Method

The final configuration, which addresses all of the above issues is:

``` apache
# Enable MultiViews for content negotiation
Options +MultiViews

# Treat .gz as gzip encoding, not application/gzip type
RemoveType .gz
AddEncoding gzip .gz

# Treat .brotli as br encoding
# Note:  If using .br for brotli, uncomment the following line:
#RemoveLanguage .br
AddEncoding br .brotli

# As an exception, send .tar.gz files as gzip type, not gzip encoding
<FilesMatch ".+\.tar\.gz$">
    RemoveEncoding .gz
    # Note:  Can use application/x-gzip for backwards-compatibility
    AddType application/gzip .gz
    # Alternatively:
    #ForceType application/gzip
</FilesMatch>
```

This configuration **requires that uncompressed files be renamed with a
double-extension** (e.g. `style.css.css`) unless one of the alternatives in
the [Non-Negotiated Files](#non-negotiated-files) section is used.

This configuration intentionally omits support for `deflate` encoding due to
[compatibility issues](https://zlib.net/zlib_faq.html#faq39) and no
significant use case that I am aware of, since all browsers which support
deflate support gzip.  It could be easily added with `AddEncoding deflate
.zlib` or similar if desired.

This configuration also does not provide a `FilesMatch` for `.tar.brotli` since
this format is not currently widely used.  When serving tarballs that should
be saved as brotli-compressed, add a `FilesMatch` directive analogous to the
one for `tar.gz`.  Doing so is left as an exercise for the reader.

If you encounter issues with this solution, please [let me know](/contact).
Otherwise, best of luck serving pre-compressed files with Apache!
